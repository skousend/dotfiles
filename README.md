Dotfiles Configurations
=======================

This is a public directory for managing my dotfiles. I am using the dotbot utility to maintain the symlinks in my home directory.

TODOs

 * Update this README with links to dotbot
 * Update this README with workflow description
 * Create a list of vimrc examples that I like
